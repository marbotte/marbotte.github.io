I am Marius Bottin, a French ecologist living in Bogot√°, Colombia.
I am an independent researcher and I work mainly in biodiversity database management and biodiversity analyses.

This website is very new, but I will try to give it some structure over time, the idea is to publish some information about my work and the projects I participate to.
